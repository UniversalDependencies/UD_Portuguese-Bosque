To generate the release, we opted to use the sentences in the same
order as UD_Portuguese.  Using the mapping available in
documents/old/*, the code extract-sentence-order.lisp generates three
files containing the IDs in the order that they should appear in the
dev/test/train files.  Next, use generate-release.lisp to generate the
final CONLLU files.
