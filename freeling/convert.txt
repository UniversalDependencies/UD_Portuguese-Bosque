How to reproduce:

1. [not needed anymore]

2. Make sure you have perl modules for Freeling 4.0 ready to use.  See
   the Freeling documentation for more details on how to compile it and
   its API modules. 

3. Update the path to your Freeling installation in
   conll_convert_tags_from_uposf.pl

4. Execute convert.sh [NOTE: make sure you pay attention to the NOTES
   in the shell script]

5. The result from that command is four files:

   devel.conll train.conll: to be used in training treeler (see next
   steps)

   freeling.tokens palavras.tokens: to be used in comparing the
   differences between PALAVRAS and Freeling tokenization and PoS
   tagging.  Boths files have the following format:

   <WORD-FORM> <LEMMA> <EAGLES tag>

   Sentences are separated by blank spaces.  The original of the files
   are:

   freeling.tokens: we extracted the sentences from the CONLL files
   (text attribute of the <s> tags.) and ran through Freeling.

   palavras.tokens: we take the CONLL, converted to EAGLES tags, and
   extracted the relevant columns.

6. If you are unable to execute these steps, the directory
   pregenerated/ contains a version of those files.

7. To train treeler, see train/readme.txt
